      "question": "How does the intrinsic carrier concentration (ni) depend on the bandgap energy (Eg)?",
      "options": [
        "ni increases as Eg increases",
        "ni decreases as Eg increases",
        "ni is independent of Eg",
        "The relationship is not exponential"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanations": [
        "Incorrect. This is the opposite of the actual relationship. As Eg increases, it becomes harder for electrons to be thermally excited across the bandgap, resulting in fewer intrinsic carriers.",
        "Correct! The intrinsic carrier concentration decreases exponentially as the bandgap energy increases. This is described by the equation ni ∝ exp(-Eg/2kT). A larger bandgap means fewer carriers can be thermally excited across the gap.",
        "Incorrect. The intrinsic carrier concentration is strongly dependent on the bandgap energy. They are not independent of each other.",
        "Incorrect. The relationship between ni and Eg is indeed exponential, as described by the equation ni ∝ exp(-Eg/2kT)."

      "question": "In an n-type semiconductor, which expression correctly represents the electron concentration?",
      "options": [
        "n = ni^2 / ND",
        "n ≈ ND",
        "n = ni",
        "n = ND - ni"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanations": [
        "Incorrect. This expression actually represents the hole concentration (p) in an n-type semiconductor, not the electron concentration.",
        "Correct! In an n-type semiconductor, the electron concentration is approximately equal to the donor concentration (ND) under most conditions, assuming complete ionization of donors.",
        "Incorrect. This would be true for an intrinsic semiconductor. In an n-type semiconductor, the electron concentration is much higher than the intrinsic carrier concentration.",
        "Incorrect. While this expression attempts to account for both donors and intrinsic carriers, it's not the correct representation. In most cases, ND >> ni, so n ≈ ND is a better approximation."

      "question": "How does temperature affect the ionization of dopants in a semiconductor?",
      "options": [
        "Higher temperature leads to more ionized dopants",
        "Higher temperature leads to fewer ionized dopants",
        "Temperature has no effect on dopant ionization",
        "The effect depends on the type of semiconductor"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanations": [
        "Correct! As temperature increases, more thermal energy is available to ionize dopants. This leads to a higher percentage of ionized dopants at higher temperatures.",
        "Incorrect. Higher temperatures actually increase the ionization of dopants due to increased thermal energy available for ionization.",
        "Incorrect. Temperature has a significant effect on dopant ionization. Ionization is a thermally activated process.",
        "Incorrect. While different semiconductors may have different ionization energies, the general trend of increased ionization with temperature holds for both n-type and p-type semiconductors."

      "question": "What happens to the Fermi level as the temperature approaches absolute zero in an n-type semiconductor?",
      "options": [
        "It moves to the middle of the bandgap",
        "It moves closer to the conduction band edge",
        "It moves into the conduction band",
        "It moves closer to the donor energy level"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanations": [
        "Incorrect. In an n-type semiconductor, the Fermi level doesn't move to the middle of the bandgap as temperature approaches zero. It remains closer to the conduction band.",
        "Incorrect. While the Fermi level is closer to the conduction band in an n-type semiconductor, it doesn't move even closer as temperature approaches zero.",
        "Incorrect. The Fermi level doesn't move into the conduction band as temperature approaches zero in a non-degenerate n-type semiconductor.",
        "Correct! As temperature approaches absolute zero, the Fermi level in an n-type semiconductor moves closer to the donor energy level, halfway between the donor level and the conduction band edge."

        "In the valence band",
        "Just below the conduction band"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanations": [
        "Incorrect. In a degenerate p-type semiconductor, the Fermi level is not in the middle of the bandgap. It's much closer to, or even inside, the valence band.",
        "Incorrect. While this would be true for a non-degenerate p-type semiconductor, in the degenerate case, the Fermi level actually moves into the valence band.",
        "Correct! In a degenerate p-type semiconductor, the Fermi level is located within the valence band due to the very high concentration of holes.",
        "Incorrect. In a p-type semiconductor, degenerate or not, the Fermi level is closer to the valence band, not the conduction band."
